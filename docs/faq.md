  <summary><b>A prompt I was using isn't working anymore, what's going on?</b></summary>

Remember that these a probabilistic models, so theres no guarantee that responses will be uniform across multiple inputs. Additionally, there's always the chance that the model was updated and now responds differently! In either case, there's no 'easy fix' - you'll likely have to find a way to reconstruct your prompt in order to get a desired input.
