# Tools

This section contains a list of non-IDE tools that are useful for prompting.

## Prompt Development, Testing, and Chaining

### [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/)

> Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

> This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.

### [OpenPrompt](https://thunlp.github.io/OpenPrompt/)(@ding2021openprompt)

> Prompt-learning is the latest paradigm to adapt pre-trained language models (PLMs) to downstream NLP tasks, which modifies the input text with a textual template and directly uses PLMs to conduct pre-trained tasks. OpenPrompt is a library built upon PyTorch and provides a standard, flexible and extensible framework to deploy the prompt-learning pipeline. OpenPrompt supports loading PLMs directly from huggingface transformers. In the future, we will also support PLMs implemented by other libraries.

### [BetterPrompt](https://github.com/krrishdholakia/betterprompt)

### [Prompt Engine](https://github.com/microsoft/prompt-engine)

> NPM utility library for creating and maintaining prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs).

### [TextBox](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/TextBox)(@tang2022textbox)

> TextBox 2.0 is an up-to-date text generation library based on Python and PyTorch focusing on building a unified and standardized pipeline for applying pre-trained language models to text generation:

### [GPT Index](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)(@Liu_GPT_Index_2022)

> GPT Index is a project consisting of a set of data structures designed to make it easier to use large external knowledge bases with LLMs
