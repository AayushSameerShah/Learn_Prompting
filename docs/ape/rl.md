## TEMPERA

**TE**st-ti**M**e **P**rompt **E**diting using **R**einforcement le**A**rning 
(TEMPERA)(@zhang2022tempera) is a method for automatically generating
interpretable prompts.




For example, Lu et al. (2022) found that the prompt order can have a large effect on the final task performance; Zhao et al. (2021) show that the choice of prompt format, training examples, and prompt order can cause the performance to vary quite significantly.

For example, Liu et al. (2022) propose to retrieve exemplars from a training pool that are semantically similar to a test example, and show it can significantly boost the performance




significant gains compared with recent SoTA approaches like prompt tun- ing, AutoPrompt, and RLPrompt
